### Linear Regression using GA

- Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data
- We can use linear regression to solve linear equation Y=aX+b, Meanwhile, a is the slope of the line
another representation of Y=mX + b, or Y=&#952;1X + &#952;0

- The most common method for fitting a regression line is the method of least-squares

### Goal of Linear regression

To find a continuous or real number and best line fit between Y=aX+b

### Dataset

It's using a naive dataset based on the age and glucose

|Ages | Glucose|
|-----|--------|
|43   | 99|
|21   | 65|
|25   | 79|
|42   | 75|
|57   | 87| 
|59   | 81|
    
The task is find appropriate a and b parameters for Y = aX + b
, and answer a query what would be the value of Y when X = 65

### Machine Linear Regression

You can check the difference between the GA linear regression and Machine linear regression by using `sklearn.linear_model` https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html
